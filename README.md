### Archived

The original motivation for open source netpoll-http2 is to unify the http2 layers of the [kitex]([url](https://github.com/cloudwego/kitex)) and [hertz]([url](https://github.com/cloudwego/hertz)). But as the project developed, kitex and hertz are both not using this library now.

So, for long-term maintenance, we decided to archive this project.

This is a HTTP/2 implementation based [netpoll](https://github.com/cloudwego/netpoll) for Go.

Demo server/client at h2demo

Help & bug reports welcome!

Thanks: https://golang.org/x/net/http2
